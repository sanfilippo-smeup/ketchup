# This file is mandatory to preventy a strange issue happening when ESLint encounters a symlinked package
# @see https://github.com/webpack-contrib/eslint-loader/issues/202
# By adding this line of ignore, ESLint will ignore all folders named dist.
# Personallly I think this is not a great solution, but it seems to be better then the other one.
